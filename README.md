# All countries' most spoken first and second tongues, ranked

We rank the most spoken first and/or second tongues in each country, for all countries. We don't use just the number of speakers. A tongue that's the most spoken first tongue in one country and the most spoken second tongue in another will rank higher than one spoken only as a first tongue, and much higher than one spoken only as a second tongue. But a second tongue with many speakers will outrank a first tongue with a few speakers.

To highlight this, we've arbitrarily grouped the tongues into categories, labelled by Roman numbers and arranged diagonally across the table's rows and columns. Tongues within the same group are roughly equivalent in ranking. Keep in mind, though, that as you scroll down the table, the data becomes less precise.

The main issue with this method is that big countries like Brasil, Canada, China, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and the U.S. have so many regional tongues that some are bound to be missed. A better way would be to look at smaller regions within these countries (https://www.mapchart.net/world-subdivisions.html).

Other key points:

- We've left out Okinawan and Jeju, because they have fewer than 10,000 speakers and make up less than 1% of their country's population.
- Some tongues here are undergoing creolisation, like Kongo [kon], which is shifting into Kituba [ktu, mkw].
- For now, we've grouped all Nahuatl tongues together.
