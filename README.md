# Tongues of the world, ranked

We rank the world's most spoken languages. However, we don't use just the number of speakers. We give more weight to languages spoken as a first and/or second language in at least one country. For example, if a tongue is spoken as a first language is one country and as a second language in another, then it will rank higher than one that's spoken only a first language, and even more so than a one that's only a second language. At the same time, a second language with a lot of speakers will rank higher than a first language with a few speakers. To highlight this, we've arbitrarily bunched the languages into groups (labelled by Roman numbers and developing diagonally across the rows and columns of the table), with languages in the same group being roughly equivalent. Yet, keep in mind that, as one scrolls down the table, the data becomes less precise.

This list isn't meant to be exhaustive. Big countries like Brasil, Canada, China, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and the U.S. have so many regional languages that some are bound to be missed. A better way would be to focus on smaller regions within these countries (https://www.mapchart.net/world-subdivisions.html).

Some key points:

- We've cut out Okinawan and Jeju, because they have fewer than 10,000 speakers and make up less than 1% of their country's population.
- Some tongues listed here are undergoing creolisation, like Kongo [kon], which is shifting into Kituba [ktu, mkw].
- For the time being, we've grouped all Nahuatl tongues together.
